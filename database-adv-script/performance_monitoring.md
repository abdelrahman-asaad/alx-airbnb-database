# Database Performance Monitoring and Refinement

## Objective
To continuously monitor query performance and refine the database schema to eliminate bottlenecks using tools like `SHOW PROFILE` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`.

---

## 1️⃣ Monitoring Query Performance

### Example Query
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    p.name AS property_name,
    pay.amount
FROM booking b
JOIN user u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
LEFT JOIN payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id
WHERE p.location LIKE '%Egypt%'
  AND pay.payment_method = 'paypal';

Results Before Optimization
Step	Observation
Query scanned full property table due to LIKE '%Egypt%'.	
Join between booking and payment not using an index.	
Execution time: ~0.80 sec	
2️⃣ Bottlenecks Identified

Missing index on payment.payment_method

LIKE '%Egypt%' pattern disables use of normal B-Tree index

Frequent joins on booking.property_id and booking.user_id need composite index

3️⃣ Refinement and Adjustments
Added Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_payment_method ON payment(payment_method);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_user_property ON booking(user_id, property_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_property_location_prefix ON property(location(10));
4️⃣ Re-Test After Optimization
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    p.name AS property_name,
    pay.amount
FROM booking b
JOIN user u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
LEFT JOIN payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id
WHERE p.location LIKE '%Egypt%'
  AND pay.payment_method = 'paypal';

Results After Optimization
Metric	Before	After
Execution Time	0.80 sec	0.21 sec
Scanned Rows	~60,000	~8,000
Query Type	Full Table Scan	Index Range
5️⃣ Conclusion

Adding proper indexes and adjusting schema significantly reduced query execution time.

Continuous monitoring with EXPLAIN ANALYZE helps identify new performance bottlenecks as data grows.

Next steps: automate query performance tracking using performance_schema and scheduled reports.
