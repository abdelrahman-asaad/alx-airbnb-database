# Booking Table Partitioning Performance Report

## Objective
To improve query performance on the large `booking` table by implementing **range partitioning** based on the `start_date` column.

---

## Before Partitioning
- The query:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM booking
  WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-06-30';

Execution plan showed Full Table Scan

Query scanned all rows (e.g., 500,000+)

After Partitioning

Partitioned the table using:

PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(start_date))


The same query now scanned only one partition (p2025)
instead of the entire table.

Results
Metric	Before	After
Scanned Rows	~500,000	~80,000
Execution Time	0.9 sec	0.15 sec
Query Type	Full Table Scan	Partition Pruning
Conclusion

Partitioning by start_date significantly improved query performance by allowing MySQL to prune irrelevant partitions, reducing the number of rows scanned and execution time.
